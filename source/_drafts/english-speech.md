## Class 1 essay

Generative AI Enhances Human Creativity

To begin with my argument, I'll tell a story of my own. In the summer vacation, with generative AI I developed a online notebook application whose design may be innovative and unique in my view. To complete this work I, a high school student, used AI to generative tons of code. People's creativity comes from their whims, and most of them just evaporate for their limited capbility. However, when AI's knowledge and skills shelter the whims from the complexity of the reality, our whims could transform into a true, creativity, rather than fade out in our mind. This is the first point.

Secondly, AI proivdes a more accessible platform for every one to gain knowledge. We can't deny that creativity is based on knowledge. Primitive human can't imagine the Internet while the under-educated people can't understand generative AI's structure as well. Today ,those difficult conception could be explained by AI, those hidden tips could be unearthed from the corner of the Internet by AI, and those people, who consist the most part of the world and can't accept the best education, could have the most patient teacher. So AI will definitely enhance creativity by expanding the soil it comes from.

Lastly, if we omit the content I had explained and stubbornly insist AI hinder the creativity, saying like "AI's convenient answer prevent people from thinking" or some prediction about a dark future with AI, I will say that it's not AI hinder our creativity. When employers replace workers with ai without considering their lives, when some people depending on ai give up thinking deeply, the faughts were always on people ourselves. It may be inappropriate structure of society or the laziness of human nature. AI is just a knife and people decide who it will attack.

As a summry, AI has enhanced and will constantly enhance human's creativity by realizing the whims that we could already quit and popularizing the knowledge be the basical root of creativity.
